Welcome to Domi Engineering!
====================

So you're now an Engineer at Domi! Congrats! You are now poised and ready to work through complex array of issues delvirng beautiful, clean software to users. It's exiting times. 

In this Engineering Major we will cover a variety of topics:
- Front-end and Web Design
- Back-end with Ruby on Rails
- Ruby
- Javascript and Javascript Frameworks
- IOS
- Android

Our current stack at Domi is a Rails application with a a little front-end magic. But as we evolve as an application, we aim to become a full-scale professional-grade service. With this, we will begin to compartmentalize Domi, breaking it into digestable, modular piecs for both speed and the ability to test and change things faster without affecting the application too much.

This allows us to make an application using the best tools that communicate better together without running into a great degree of technical debt and finding ourselves with a bloated application desparate for a rewrite.
