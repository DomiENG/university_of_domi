Welcome to the University of Domi!
====================

Domi University is designed to take smart individuals new to the intricaices of startups and technology and make them into smart

This is an ever expanding list and I am of course open to any and all feedback. 

At Domi, you will be required to select a major usualy fitting the profile of the work you have agreed to do with us. From there, you are free to double-major or minor adding areas of interest you seem interesting that you find interesting.

Content
====================

The goal of The University of Domi is to give Domi team members access to some of the best content online. You will read the likes of Paul Graham, work on improving your skills in Web Development, understand the Philopshy behing a startup with Peter Thiel, learn about culture, growth hacking, "doing things that don't scale", "making something people want", and "jab, jab, jab, right hook". 

We hope you enjoy this adventure and when you look back at graduation hope you have found what you learned here and with Domi a major catalyst in your future success.
