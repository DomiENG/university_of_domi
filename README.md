Welcome to the University of Domi!
====================

Domi University is designed to take smart individuals new to the intricacies of startups and technology and make them into smart
individuals knowing the depths of startups and technology. 

We do this very simply, the same way you go to school. The University of Domi is broken up into a series of majors. 

Majors include:
---------------------

- Social, Communications, and Community
- Business and Operations

Minors include:
---------------------

- Philosophy
- Networking
- Sales
- More to come

This is an ever expanding list and I am of course open to any and all feedback on improving the curriculum. As well as various typos... 

At Domi, you will be required to select a major usualy fitting the profile of the work you have agreed to do with us. From there, you are free to double-major or minor adding areas of interest that you find fancy.

Content
====================

The goal of The University of Domi is to give Domi team members access to some of the best content online. You will read the likes of Paul Graham, work on improving your skills in Web Development, understand the Philopshy behind a startup, learn about culture, growth hacking, "doing things that don't scale", "making something people want", and "jab, jab, jab, right hook". 

We hope you enjoy this adventure and when you look back at graduation hope you have found what you learned here and with Domi a major catalyst in your future success.
